# Physical Infrastructure and Hardware Architecture

**Document id:** SE11-PHYSICAL-INFRASTR-HARDWARE v3 (revision of v2 after review findings REVIEWER-EN-SE11-PHYSICAL-001 … 006, 008, 009) · **Owner:** SE11 (Infrastructure, Containers & Runtime Engineering, SEED-01 §74) · **Run:** SMK-20261103114255 · **Baseline state:** PROVISIONAL, specification-class baseline, no part-number fingerprint (§0, §11, §17)

**Purpose.** This is the single engineering disposition of the Master Product Vision hardware strategy and reference BOM. It turns the seed's reference configuration into one coherent physical architecture (compute, storage, network, power/placement, management, failure domains), records every BOM item's disposition, and defines the validation evidence that downstream owners (EL, SE01, SE12, SE14, SE17, SE19, SE20, Stage-14 plans) cite by this document id and the disposition they rely on. It selects no vendor, prices nothing and purchases nothing (§15).

**Source baseline (hardware planning chain, ENV-DEC-017).** SEED-01 "CSPUI — Master Product Vision & Operating Architecture — Proposed Revision 1.1, Expanded 2026 Baseline" (repository sha `2d3a171d6961a8790f5a9812eeb1e3907f188242`), consumed sections: hardware strategy §152–§177 (document sections 37–45, including the section-40 reference-configuration table inside §160), the BOM "Appendix G. Reference Greenfield Infrastructure BOM — Optional Baseline (v2.2)" (status note at the end of §226; items §227.1–§227.11, §228.1–§228.3, §229.1–§229.2, §230, §231), the guardrails Appendix H (§232–§238) and the domain list §74. No BOM content is recreated from memory; every specification cited below is taken from those sections, re-read in this revision.

## 0. Document status, source availability and limitation

### 0.1 Inputs: what was available and what was not (re-verified for v3)

| Input (context id) | Availability at authoring (v3) | What SE11 needed from it | Effect of absence on this document |
|---|---|---|---|
| PL-REQ-ID-REGISTER (required source) | **Absent** — context block marked "missing"; `list_documents 10-Product-Lead/` returns no files | Requirement / decision / constraint ids with full specification and seed section | **UNMET SOURCE (SE11-DEP-01).** Not "inapplicable": the register applies and is required. The maximum achievable mapping with the inputs that do exist is pre-built in §0.5 (a seed-section crosswalk keyed exactly as register rows are keyed); no register id is cited or invented. The restriction on implementation (§17) stays until SE11-AC-11 attaches register ids. |
| PL-REQ-REGISTER-G01 … G04 (register fragments) | **Absent** (index lists 60 chars, 0 sections) | Verbatim BOM appendix | BOM read directly from SEED-01 §227–§231, which the hardware chain rule permits for SE11. |
| PM09-* (14 product documents) | **Absent** (`list_documents 20-Product-Domains/PM09/` empty) | MVP scope, product NFRs, acceptance criteria, risks/constraints, decision log, KPIs | Product-level targets are not reconciled. Every NFR value in §3 is an SE11 engineering proposal (ASM-SE11-06). |
| NT16-* (8 vendor/dependency documents) | **Absent** | External-dependency and SLA requirements, exit/replacement assessment | External-provider residual risks (FD-EXT-AI, FD-INTERNET, hosted equivalents, T3 provider) are stated from the seed only (SE11-DEP-09). |
| EL-* (26 engineering-lead documents) | **Absent** (`list_documents 40-Engineering-Lead/EL/Outputs/` empty) | System/runtime/deployment/reliability architecture, NFR ids, ADRs, interface-contract governance, estimates, sequencing, DoR/DoD | No EL decision id is cited; no EL review has occurred; the provided contract is DEFINED-UNREGISTERED (§18.2, SE11-DEP-02). |
| SP16-* (7 FinOps documents) | **Absent** | Cost allocation, spend guardrails, unit economics | The economic half of the seed's justification rule for local capacity (§238) cannot be evaluated; local-versus-hosted stays open per pool (SE11-ADR-01, gate G-LOCAL, SE11-DEP-08). |
| SEED-01 (seed, read on demand) | Available | Hardware strategy and BOM | Sole substantive input of this version. The seed is also the common root from which every absent upstream document would have been derived, so the consistency checks of §0.5 are run against it. |

### 0.2 Decision status model

Every decision, requirement and NFR in this version carries the status **PROV** (provisional, seed-derived, not reconciled). The status **REC** (reconciled: register ids attached, EL review recorded, upstream product/NFR documents checked) can only be assigned by a later version after SE11-AC-11 passes. **No entry in v3 is REC.** Downstream documents that cite this version cite it as `SE11-PHYSICAL-INFRASTR-HARDWARE v3 (PROVISIONAL)` and carry the same provisional status for anything derived from it (SE11-REQ-11).

### 0.3 Source disposition in the completion event (corrects finding 001)

The v2 reading "`not_applicable` = could not be applied" is withdrawn: a missing source is not an inapplicable source. The substantive disposition of PL-REQ-ID-REGISTER is **UNMET SOURCE** (SE11-DEP-01). The completion-event schema admits only `covered` or `not_applicable`; this document reports `covered` with the meaning fixed by the global rules' corpus-silence procedure and nothing more: the source was sought and found absent; the absence is an explicit labelled assumption (ASM-SE11-01); the content the source would have supplied is replaced, to the extent the rules allow, by direct citation of the seed sections that the register rows themselves cite, pre-mapped in §0.5; no register id is cited, invented or approximated. `covered` therefore does **not** mean "consumed" or "reconciled". The gap is not resolved; §17 keeps the baseline PROVISIONAL and not approved for implementation until SE11-AC-11 passes.

### 0.4 Disposition of the v2 review findings

| Finding | Correction made in v3 | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 001 source gap reported as not_applicable; no register mapping or upstream checks | `not_applicable` interpretation removed (§0.3); UNMET SOURCE disposition with dependency id; the register mapping is pre-built as a seed-section crosswalk for every SE11 id (§0.5); consistency checks run against the only available authoritative input (SEED-01) with six **actual conflicts/deviations recorded and dispositioned** (C1–C6, §0.5 and §16.6); implementation restriction retained (§17); no ids, approvals or availability fabricated | §0.3, §0.5, §16.6, §17, §19 |
| 002 automatic ">32 GB component → M-B" rule bypassed workload sizing | Rule deleted. 256 GB (M-B or M-A+) is selectable only from an aggregate concurrent reservation calculation (host reserve + WSL cap + statics + dynamic minima/maxima + headroom) and only after reallocation within the installed candidate (step 1) and the hosted alternative (step 2) have been tried and their failure recorded in SE11-DEC-03a; worked example included | §5.3 |
| 003 contracts unregistered, consumed interfaces unbound, yet decisions rely on them | No owner contract exists in the corpus, so none is cited or invented. Each consumed interface is now an **unmet dependency with an id (SE11-DEP-nn)** stating the dependent SE11 ids and the behaviour while unmet; the provided contract is DEFINED-UNREGISTERED with the two registration steps (SE11's Interface Contract document, EL's register) listed as unmet dependencies; NFR mappings and security-control references point to the dependency ids rather than claiming coverage | §18, §3, §13 |
| 004 inconsistent reservation numbers; M-A headroom violation; undefined "shedding order" | One authoritative per-candidate reservation table (Table 5.3-R); §4 no longer carries memory numbers; every total and both admission checks derived from the table; M-A re-balanced so that 128 GB satisfies both checks; weighted contention (hypervisor reserves/weights, measurable) separated from load shedding (scheduler action owned by EL/SE01, driven by SE11-published signals); SE11-NFR-01 and SE11-AC-12 restated as weighted-service guarantees | §4, §5.2, §5.3, SE11-DEC-11, SE11-ADR-10, §14 |
| 005 Validation unprotected from Build I/O when QoS absent; fallback impact mis-stated | Storage protection matrix for every combination of lane coexistence × QoS availability with a decidable calibration rule for limits (V_min, B_max from measured device capacity), guest-side `io.max` as the alternative limiter, a new first fallback (NIC relocated to PCI_E1 while the GPU is deferred) that avoids sharing altogether, the double-fallback allowed only on a passed contention test, and the lane-sharing fallback impact corrected to include Validation; acceptance SE11-AC-12b measures the critical-validation storage outcome | §6.1, §6.1a, SE11-REQ-16, SE11-DEC-12, §14 |
| 006 shutdown budget understated; NAS runtime not separated; restart undefined for restoration during S2 / without output power cycle | Candidate-specific timed sequences (S-1, S-2, S-3) with explicit concurrent/serial steps, bounded retries, critical-path totals and a remaining-runtime requirement per UPS; B recomputed per candidate; restart mechanisms defined (M1 commanded output power-cycle, M3 RTC wake, M4 attended residual; N1 WOL for the NAS) with gates and a low-charge rule; all scenarios added to SE11-AC-06/14/15 with pass criteria | §8.3, §8.4, SE11-REQ-15, SE11-DEC-13, §14 |
| 008 QC-AR-03 reported not_applicable although applicable; no evidence; no fingerprint | Reported as **addressed by design change, evidence UNMET**: part numbers are no longer baselined — every part number is DEFERRED-PENDING-EVIDENCE (SE11-DEC-14) and the baseline is bound to specification classes (§11.4) plus the seed sha; pre-build checks (SE11-AC-01) stay separate from commissioning tests; no criterion closure at part-number level and no implementation-ready sign-off is claimed | §1.2, §11.2, §11.3, §17, §19 |
| 009 degraded protection contradicted invariants; outage tolerance ignored copy age | Per-class protection states (ABSENT / PROTECTED / DEGRADED-IN-BUDGET / EXPIRED) with last-successful-copy timestamp, maximum copy age A_max and grace G, explicit creation and mutation permissions, expiry actions (T3-SUB isolated local copy, else write-freeze of the class), restoration rule; invariants, failure table and SE11-AC-10 reconciled; outage tolerance = remaining copy-age budget; expiry-during-outage drill SE11-AC-07c | §6.3, SE11-REQ-17, §9, §14 |

### 0.5 Pre-register crosswalk and upstream consistency check (what can be done with the available authoritative input)

**Crosswalk.** PL-REQ-ID-REGISTER rows name the seed section they distil. The table below therefore keys every SE11 identifier to the SEED-01 section(s) it derives from, so that attaching register ids in SE11-AC-11 is a lookup, not a re-derivation. Column "Register id" is deliberately empty-by-rule (UNMET, SE11-DEP-01).

**Upstream consistency check (performed against SEED-01 as the common root; the absent EL/PM09/NT16/SP16 documents cannot be checked and no consistency with them is asserted).** Result: six actual deviations/conflicts between this architecture and the literal seed text, each with a disposition. They are the only known conflicts; §16.6 repeats them in the Conflicts section as the rules require.

| Id | Seed statement | This document | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | §165: the rack UPS "feeds rack PDU for local worker nodes **and switch** when used" | The core switch is powered from PD-A (UPS-A), not the deferred rack UPS, because in candidate S-1 the NAS shutdown command crosses it and because the rack does not exist at baseline | Deviation accepted (SE11-DEC-08): the seed's placement presupposes a rack; while PD-B is absent the switch must be on battery-backed PD-A; when the rack exists the switch stays on PD-A unless S-3 (no command path) is in use, in which case it may move to PD-B as the seed states. Reviewers resolve if they read §165 as mandatory |
| C2 | §227.6: M2_4 = "platform data / DBs / containers", M2_2 = "VM & artifact store" | Highest-priority VM system disks are placed on M2_4 with the data; M2_2 carries High/Medium VM disks and artifacts | Deviation recorded as SE11-DEC-09/ADR-09 with reason (§157 reservation principle, §174 priority classes) and impact (§6.1) |
| C3 | §165/§229.1: one PC+NAS UPS with "automatic graceful shutdown via PowerPanel / NAS UPS service" | SE11 does not assert that any host↔NAS signalling combination works; candidate S-3 substitutes a second UPS for the NAS | Gated decision SE11-DEC-10; S-3 is a topology substitution of B15 recorded with reason (no evidenced cross-device integration) and impact (second UPS of the B16 class, separate runtime budget) |
| C4 | §166/§230: switch and rack items apply "if local rack infrastructure is selected" | The managed switch (class) is adopted at baseline without a rack | Deviation accepted (SE11-ADR-07): three or more endpoints (host 10 GbE, host 5 GbE, NAS 10 GbE, NAS 5 GbE management, gateway, UPS software endpoint) and VLAN enforcement of `seg.*` need a switch regardless of the rack; the smallest class satisfying §230 is used (§158 no-overbuild); the interim point-to-point placement of §7.2 remains allowed |
| C5 | §227.4 and §228.3 list 4×64 GB and 6×20 TB as the reference quantities | Quantities are candidates sized by rule; defaults M-A (128 GB) and N-A (4 drives) | Not a conflict: §162 ("evidence-driven sizing decision, not a fixed prerequisite"), §164 ("according to retention policy") and §238 make the quantities conditional; recorded for transparency (SE11-ADR-08) |
| C6 | §0: Rev 1.1 is "proposed"; "the approved v1.0 document remains authoritative until this revision is explicitly approved" | Rev 1.1 is treated as the operative seed because only Rev 1.1 contains the hardware baseline | ASM-SE11-02, SE11-RISK-08; sign-off bound to the Rev 1.1 sha so that approval or change re-enters this document |

| Approval status of the seed | §0: "The approved v1.0 document remains authoritative until this revision is explicitly approved." The hardware baseline exists only in Rev 1.1 (conflict C6, ASM-SE11-02); sign-off binds to that exact revision and sha (§17). |

### 1.2 Classification and engineering disposition of every BOM entry

The seed states that Appendix G "is a greenfield reference configuration, not an assertion of already-owned equipment or a mandatory topology" and that Product/Engineering "may procure, substitute, resize, or use hosted equivalents when evidence shows equal or better capability, reliability, portability, security, schedule, and economics" (§226 status note); that "local central compute, NAS, power, and worker infrastructure should be provisioned when workload evidence and economics justify it; managed/hosted equivalents remain acceptable where they better satisfy the target requirements" (§238); and that the central node "is a reference configuration rather than an inherited constraint" (§160, section 40 lead-in).

**Reading rules for the table.** (a) A disposition is the disposition *of the specification class of the reference item if local provisioning of that element is justified* under gate G-LOCAL (SE11-ADR-01); it is not a decision that local provisioning is justified. (b) **Part-number status (SE11-DEC-14, corrects finding 008):** the corpus contains no manufacturer support, firmware, qualified-list, driver or availability statement for any part number (§11.2). Every part number cited from the seed is therefore **DEFERRED-PENDING-EVIDENCE**: it is the seed's reference exemplar of the class, it is not baselined, and it becomes part of the configuration fingerprint only when its SE11-AC-01 record reads "confirmed". The *class* (§11.4) is what is adopted. Impact: there is no buildable bill in this document; downstream documents cite classes and candidate ids, never part numbers. (c) "Quantity/count status" separates the adopted class from any capacity figure, which is never adopted from the maximum listed configuration (ENV-DEC-017).

**Measurable non-functional targets introduced by this document (status PROV; binding to EL-ENGINEER-NFR-SPECIFIC ids is unmet dependency SE11-DEP-10; values are engineering proposals, ASM-SE11-06).**

| NFR id | Quality attribute | Target (measurable) | Verified by |
|---|---|---|---|
| SE11-NFR-01 | Performance efficiency / weighted-service guarantee under contention (replaces v2's "throttling order") | Under the §14 contention profile: (a) Core and Data VMs: CPU-wait ≤ 5 % in every 60 s window, Core synthetic API probe p95 ≤ 1.5 × unloaded baseline, Data 4 KiB random-read p99 ≤ 2 × unloaded baseline; (b) Validation VM: CPU-wait ≤ 10 % (it receives its full 8 vCPU from reserve + weighted floating share, §5.2); (c) Build VM: receives ≥ 11 LP-equivalents of its 16 (4 reserved + ≥ 7 floating); (d) inside the Build VM, `pool.background` receives ≤ 10 % of the VM's CPU while build jobs saturate (cgroup weight 10 : 100). No ordered shedding is claimed at the hardware layer (SE11-ADR-10) | SE11-AC-12 |
| SE11-NFR-02 | Performance efficiency / storage path | Host↔NAS ≥ 0.7 GB/s sustained for 10 min during concurrent build-cache load; no other path degrades below 80 % of its unloaded throughput | SE11-AC-05 |
| SE11-NFR-03 | Reliability / safe shutdown, per UPS and per candidate | For every UPS u in the selected candidate: B_u ≤ 0.7 × R_u, where B_u is the critical-path budget of §8.3 and R_u the measured runtime at measured load; every step completes inside its bound; restart after restoration completes within T_restart ≤ 10 min for the mechanism selected under SE11-DEC-13 | SE11-AC-06, SE11-AC-14, SE11-AC-15 |
| SE11-NFR-04 | Maintainability / observability | 100 % of §10.3 signals exported, sample interval ≤ 60 s, retained for at least one stage | SE11-AC-09 |
| SE11-NFR-05 | Recoverability (hardware-capable; SE12 binds the product RPO/RTO) | T1→T2 snapshot interval ≤ 1 h and full replication ≤ 24 h; single-VM restore from T2 ≤ 4 h; for every D-IRR class: T3 copy age ≤ A_max = 24 h in state PROTECTED, expiry at A_max + G = 48 h (§6.3); restore of each D-IRR class from T3 verified at every stage gate | SE11-AC-07a/b/c |
| SE11-NFR-06 | Availability (single-host) | No HA claim. Planned hardware maintenance only in declared windows; FD-HOST recovery to degraded service (hosted fallback or replacement host of the §11.4 class) ≤ 1 working day from T2/T3, assumption ASM-SE11-07 | SE11-AC-07, SE19 resilience tests |
| SE11-NFR-07 | Integrity after abrupt loss | After an abrupt power loss (FD-UPS-A drill), every VM filesystem, the host filesystem and the NAS array pass integrity checks with zero unrecoverable errors; database loss ≤ last committed transaction (SE12 verifies) | SE11-AC-13 |
| SE11-NFR-08 | Thermal/power envelope | ≥ 24 h combined stress with CPU package ≤ 230 W, all device temperatures within manufacturer limits, zero memory errors at the chosen DDR5 profile | SE11-AC-04 |

## 4. Workload-to-hardware allocation (OUT-SE11-PHYSICAL-INFRASTRUCTURE-HARDWARE-AR-03)

Allocation maps workload classes to **resource pools**, never to named devices; a pool is addressed by a logical name (§160: no hard-coded host names, local paths or addresses). Pools are the unit that moves between local, hosted and customer infrastructure (§168). Every pool has either its own budget or an explicit *shared-budget membership* with a stated share (SE11-REQ-01). Units: **LP** = logical processor of the host (32 LP = 16 physical cores × 2 SMT threads, B1); **vCPU** = virtual processor assigned to a guest (1 vCPU is scheduled onto 1 LP at a time). **Memory budgets are not repeated here: the single authoritative source is Table 5.3-R**, keyed by candidate; this table only names which line of Table 5.3-R applies.

| Pool | Workload class (seed §167, §169–§171, §174) | Priority (§174) | Placement in the reference configuration | CPU budget | Memory (Table 5.3-R line) | Storage device (§6.1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pool.core` | Platform core: orchestration, APIs, queues, registry/control | Highest | Linux VM "Core" | 4 vCPU; Hyper-V reserve 100 % (= 4 LP guaranteed); limit 100 %; weight 200 | Core VM static | M2_4 |
| `pool.data` | Databases, search/knowledge data, caches | Highest | Linux VM "Data" (hosted under candidate M-C) | 4 vCPU; reserve 100 % (4 LP); weight 200 | Data VM static | M2_4 |
| `pool.runtime` | Stable runtime of accepted stage baselines (§156, §235) | Highest | **Shared-budget member of `pool.core` and `pool.data`**: runtime namespaces inside the Core and Data VMs with separate projects, credentials, networks, data paths (§156). Share: within each VM, runtime namespaces hold cgroup `cpu.weight` ≥ 3 × the platform-control namespaces and `memory.min` ≥ 50 % of the VM's static memory (defaults; EL binds the exact values) | inherits | inherits | M2_4 |
| `pool.validate` | Integration, security validation, staging, release challenger, VP validation | High | Linux VM "Validation/Staging" | 8 vCPU; reserve 50 % (4 LP guaranteed); limit 100 %; weight 150 | Validation dynamic min/max | M2_2 (protected per §6.1a) |
| `pool.build` | CI runners, build cache, artifact generation | Medium | Linux VM "Build/CI" | 16 vCPU; reserve 25 % (4 LP guaranteed); limit 100 %; weight 100 | Build dynamic min/max | M2_2 (VM disk, artifacts) + M2_3 (scratch; fallbacks §6.1a) |
| `pool.agents` | API-based model workers | Medium | Hosted/cloud executors first. When local: **member of `pool.build` budget** as containers in the Build VM with cgroup `cpu.max` ≤ 50 % and `memory.max` ≤ 40 % of the VM | member | member | M2_2 |
| `pool.test` | Test/browser/scanning workers, synthetic users | Medium / lowest | As `pool.agents`: **member of `pool.build` budget**, `cpu.max` ≤ 50 %, `memory.max` ≤ 40 %; agents + tests together never exceed the Build VM's own ceiling | member | member | M2_2 |
| `pool.background` | Background analysis, documentation, low-priority optimisation | Lowest | **Member of `pool.build` budget**: cgroup `cpu.weight` 10 (vs 100 for build jobs), `cpu.max` ≤ 25 %, no memory guarantee; the scheduler sheds it first (§175, SE11-DEC-11) | member | member | M2_2 |
| `pool.gpu` | Local inference, embeddings, vision, evaluation (§176) | Medium | DEFERRED — PCI_E1 when adopted (§5.5); external providers meanwhile (§160) | — | — | — |
| `pool.durable` | Backups, snapshots, release evidence, archives, mirrors (§164) | n/a | NAS T2 (+ T3 isolated copy, §6.3) | — | — | NAS |
| `pool.admin` | Host OS, Hyper-V root, WSL2 + Docker Desktop interactive use (§167) | n/a | Windows host root partition | Not reservable in Hyper-V; the root partition takes floating LPs (§5.2); operational rule: VM reserves sum ≤ 16 LP so ≥ 16 LP float | Host root reserve + WSL2 cap | M2_1 |

**Simultaneous CPU accounting at baseline:** vCPUs assigned to VMs = 4 + 4 + 8 + 16 = **32 vCPU on 32 LP** (1 : 1, no vCPU oversubscription at baseline; bursts happen *within* a VM's own vCPU count). Guaranteed LPs (sum of reserves) = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **16 LP (50 %)**. Floating LPs = **16**, taken first by the host root partition (typical need 2–4 LP, ASM-SE11-03) and then by VMs in weight proportion 150 : 100 (Core and Data cannot take floating LPs: their 4 vCPU are already fully reserved). Under full saturation this arithmetic gives Validation its remaining 4 vCPU in full (its weighted share of 12–14 floating LPs, 0.6 × 12 = 7.2, exceeds the 4 it can use) and leaves Build with 4 reserved + 8–10 floating = 12–14 of its 16 vCPU. That is a **weighted-contention outcome**, measurable as SE11-NFR-01, not an ordered shedding mechanism.

**Weighted contention versus load shedding (corrects finding 004; SE11-ADR-10, SE11-DEC-11).** Two different things were conflated in v2:

1. *Weighted contention* is what the hypervisor's reserve/limit/weight controls and the in-VM cgroup weights produce automatically under saturation. It needs no controller; its guarantees are those of SE11-NFR-01 and are measured by SE11-AC-12.
2. *Load shedding* — pausing, cancelling or refusing noncritical jobs "when hardware capacity, network, storage, AI quota or power conditions degrade" (§175) — is a **scheduler action**, owned by EL (orchestration/scheduler) and SE01. SE11 does not design the controller or its transitions. SE11's obligation is to **publish the signals** on which the scheduler acts, each delivered to the telemetry/event path of §10.3 within 60 s of the condition: `SIG-ONBATTERY` (UPS state S1 entered / left), `SIG-SHUTDOWN` (state S2 entered: no further scheduling will be honoured; jobs have ≤ 60 s), `SIG-THERMAL` (any monitored temperature above its manufacturer limit minus 5 °C), `SIG-STORAGE-PRESSURE` (any T1 device > 85 % used or any NVMe > 80 % TBW), `SIG-PROTECTION-STATE` (any D-IRR class leaves PROTECTED, §6.3), `SIG-PL-STATE` (platform protection level). Which jobs the scheduler sheds on each signal is EL/SE01 policy (unmet dependency SE11-DEP-03); the default expectation recorded for them, derived from §174/§175, is background → build → validation, with runtime never shed.

Rule SE11-REQ-01 (restated): `pool.core`, `pool.data` and `pool.runtime` reservations are hard — static memory, 100 % processor reserve, never oversubscribed; every other pool has a declared guaranteed floor and ceiling or an explicit membership share as above. Rule SE11-REQ-14: the reservation mechanism is the hypervisor's per-VM processor reserve/limit/weight and static-versus-dynamic memory controls plus in-VM cgroup shares for members; no pool relies on "best effort".

### 5.2 Processor accounting and reservation mechanism (SE11-REQ-14)

| Quantity | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Physical cores | 16 | B1 |
| Logical processors (LP) available to the hypervisor | 32 | B1 (SMT) |
| vCPUs assigned to VMs | 32 (Core 4, Data 4, Validation 8, Build 16) | §4 |
| vCPU : LP ratio | 1 : 1 at baseline | no oversubscription by vCPU count |
| Guaranteed LPs (Σ processor reserve) | 16 (Core 4, Data 4, Validation 4, Build 4) | reserve % × vCPUs |
| Floating LPs | 16 | host root partition first (2–4 LP typical, ASM-SE11-03), then Validation : Build by weight 150 : 100 |

Mechanism on the selected host platform: per-VM **processor resource controls** (virtual machine reserve %, virtual machine limit %, relative weight) and per-VM **memory controls** (static memory = hard reservation; Dynamic Memory with minimum/maximum for burst pools). Members of a shared budget (`pool.agents`, `pool.test`, `pool.background`, `pool.runtime`) are bounded inside their VM by Linux cgroup v2 `cpu.weight`, `cpu.max`, `memory.min`, `memory.max` as listed in §4. **Admission rule (all derived from Table 5.3-R):** a VM or member may be created or resized only if (a) Σ processor reserves stays ≤ 16 LP, (b) the memory floor F and ceiling C recomputed from Table 5.3-R satisfy both checks of §5.3 for the installed candidate, and (c) the pool's storage volume is already mapped in §6.1 with its §6.1a protection row. The rule is enforced by the version-controlled VM definitions and checked in SE11-AC-03; its behaviour under saturation is verified by SE11-AC-12.

### 5.3 Memory sizing: the authoritative reservation table and decision rule (SE11-DEC-03, corrects findings 002 and 004)

**Evidence status.** No measured workload exists (§0.1: EL estimates and SE01 capacity model absent, SE11-DEP-03). Table 5.3-R therefore holds **hypothetical planning allocations** (ASM-SE11-03, ASM-SE11-11) derived only from the five required logical environments (§156) and the layout (§167). They justify no quantity by themselves; the sizing document replaces them with a traceable Stage-1 inventory and measured p95 values (§234 H.3). What *is* binding is the table's structure, the two admission checks and the decision rule.

**Table 5.3-R — authoritative per-candidate memory reservations (GB). Every total in this document is derived from this table; no other section carries memory numbers.**

| Line | M-A: 2×64 GB = 128 GB (default) | M-B: 4×64 GB single kit = 256 GB | M-A+: M-A + second matched pair = 256 GB (two kits) | M-C: M-A kit, `pool.data` hosted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Host root partition reserve (hypervisor, host OS, drivers, management agents) | 12 | 16 | 16 | 12 |
| WSL2 cap (`.wslconfig`) | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| Core VM static | 20 | 32 | 32 | 20 |
| Data VM static | 32 | 64 | 64 | 0 (hosted) |
| Validation VM dynamic min → max | 8 → 20 | 16 → 48 | 16 → 48 | 8 → 24 |
| Build VM dynamic min → max | 12 → 24 | 16 → 64 | 16 → 64 | 12 → 32 |
| **Floor F** = host + WSL + statics + dynamic minima | 12+8+20+32+8+12 = **92** | 16+8+32+64+16+16 = **152** | **152** | 12+8+20+0+8+12 = **60** |
| **Ceiling C** = host + WSL + statics + dynamic maxima | 12+8+20+32+20+24 = **116** | 16+8+32+64+48+64 = **232** | **232** | 12+8+20+0+24+32 = **96** |
| Check 1: installed ≥ 1.25 × F | 128 ≥ 115 ✓ | 256 ≥ 190 ✓ | 256 ≥ 190 ✓ | 128 ≥ 75 ✓ |
| Check 2: installed ≥ C + H_min (H_min = 8) | 128 ≥ 124 ✓ | 256 ≥ 240 ✓ | 256 ≥ 240 ✓ | 128 ≥ 104 ✓ |
| Headroom at ceiling | 12 | 24 | 24 | 32 |
| Scale path | Add a second matched pair → M-A+ (SE11-AC-04 memory pass re-run; §227.4 4-DIMM fallback applies) | None (board maximum; REV-MEM) | None (board maximum; REV-MEM) | Hosted elasticity for data; local as M-A |
| Trade-off recorded | Smallest justified start (§158, §238); Data working set capped at 32 GB until re-balanced or expanded | Buys capacity the model may not demonstrate; single matched kit (§227.4); 4-DIMM training risk flagged by the seed | Two kits are not "a single matched kit" (§227.4): stability must be re-proven | Confidential-processing boundary (§66), EL latency input and SP16 economics (SE11-DEP-08) decide |

Members inside the Build VM (`pool.agents`, `pool.test`) are bounded by `memory.max` ≤ 40 % of the Build VM's *current* allocation and need no separate line.

**Decision rule (SE11-DEC-03).**

1. *Inputs.* SE11-HARDWARE-CAPACITY-SIZING produces, from a traceable Stage-1 concurrent workload inventory (the inputs EL-ENGINEER-ESTIMATE-CAPACITY and SE01 own, SE11-DEP-03), a per-pool floor and ceiling; the measured host root reserve replaces the 12/16 GB planning value (ASM-SE11-11). F and C are recomputed with the Table 5.3-R formula — **always as the aggregate of all concurrently resident pools plus host overhead plus WSL cap, never from one component**.
2. *Selection.* The initial quantity is the smallest candidate whose installed capacity satisfies **both** Check 1 (installed ≥ 1.25 × F) and Check 2 (installed ≥ C + 8 GB).
3. *Default before a model exists.* The seed's H.1 ("start productively") and H.3 ("measure before resizing") apply: **M-A with the Table 5.3-R values is installed**; the choice and basis are recorded as SE11-DEC-03a in the sizing document. M-A satisfies both checks with those values (Check 1: 128 ≥ 115; Check 2: 128 ≥ 124), so the default no longer violates the rule it is subject to.
4. *A component larger than its pool allocation* (for example a database working set of 44 GB against the M-A Data static of 32 GB) does **not** by itself select a larger candidate. The sizing document must work through, in order, and record the outcome of each step in SE11-DEC-03a:
   - **Step 1 — reallocate within the installed candidate.** Raise the affected static line and lower the dynamic maxima/minima of the other pools, keeping every pool at or above its own floor, and re-run both checks. Worked example on M-A: Data static 44, Validation 6 → 16, Build 8 → 16: F = 12+8+20+44+6+8 = 98 → 1.25 F = 122.5 ≤ 128 ✓; C = 12+8+20+44+16+16 = 116 → C + 8 = 124 ≤ 128 ✓. Both checks pass; M-A stands with a recorded re-balance. Step 1 fails only when no allocation satisfying both checks keeps every pool at or above its floor.
   - **Step 2 — hosted alternative (M-C) for the oversized component.** Permitted by §238 and §160; it fails only for a recorded reason: the confidential-processing boundary (§66) forbids hosting that data, EL's latency requirement for the Core↔Data path is not met by a hosted service, or SP16 economics (SE11-DEP-08) reject it.
   - **Step 3 — 256 GB (M-B or M-A+) only if Steps 1 and 2 both failed for recorded reasons** *and* the aggregate C from the model (not the single component) requires it under Check 2. The record in SE11-DEC-03a must show the aggregate calculation and both failed steps. **256 GB is never adopted on the strength of this document, nor on the strength of a single component.**
5. *Non-ECC* on the central node is accepted for every candidate (SE11-ADR-03) with the ECC platform class recorded as the substitute if SE11-RISK-02 materialises.

### 5.4 Virtualization / host implications

- VM count and boundaries remain an engineering decision (§167); the four Linux VMs are the minimum that satisfies the isolation rule of §156. Merging Core and Data into one VM is permitted only if the static memory lines of Table 5.3-R are preserved as a sum, both stay on M2_4, and SE17 accepts the shared blast radius.
- Highest-priority VMs (Core, Data) use static memory and 100 % processor reserve; they are never configured for dynamic over-commit (SE11-REQ-01).
- Snapshots of the Validation and Core VMs are taken before any firmware/driver change (§10.4) and replicated to `pool.durable`.
- Nothing in the VM layer may encode physical slot ids, device serials or the host name; the portability requirement §160 applies to every VM definition (SE11-REQ-05). Storage is referenced by volume label / stable identifier, not by slot.
- Per-virtual-disk IOPS controls (hypervisor storage QoS minimum/maximum) are the preferred storage limiter; their availability on the chosen host OS edition is confirmed in SE11-AC-03. If unavailable, the **guest-side limiter** of §6.1a (cgroup v2 `io.max` inside the Build VM) is mandatory — device separation alone is no longer an accepted fallback (SE11-REQ-16, corrects finding 005).

### 5.5 Accelerator (deferred) preconditions

The GPU (B11) stays DEFER / OPTIONAL until all of the following hold: (a) a measured trigger TRG-GPU (§12.2: local-inference latency/privacy/cost case or GPU-required application testing, §176); (b) SE11-AC-02 confirms PCI_E1 x16 availability — which means that if Fallback A (NIC in PCI_E1, §6.1a) is in use it must first be replaced by Fallback B or C with a passed SE11-AC-12b — plus 241 mm single-slot clearance and the 12V-2x6 cable; (c) SE11-AC-06 confirms measured full-load system draw plus 145 W ≤ 80 % of the 750 W PSU rating and that the per-candidate shutdown budgets of §8.3 still hold at the higher PD-A load; (d) SE11-AC-03 confirms a supported path to expose the GPU to a Linux VM on the client hypervisor (device assignment or partitioning) — if none exists, the fallback is a host-level local-model service exposed to VMs over the internal virtual network, recorded as a new SE11-DEC; (e) local models are registered under the same AI-dependency governance as external models (§177). Any accelerator above 145 W, a second accelerator or a dual-slot card is ESCALATE ARCHITECTURE IMPACT (SE11-ADR-04).
